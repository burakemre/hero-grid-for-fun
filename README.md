# Hero Grid

## Introduction

Hero grid is a hobby project. It is a playground for experimenting different
technologies. Other than being a playground, it will be an information grid for
popular moba games.

## Why

Because me and my friends like playing games. Why not make a site about the
things we like. Also as new grads who likes to try things, we needed somewhere
other than work to experiment. A playground!

## But it is already done ? Again why ?

DON'T YOU LISTEN YOU IGNORANT PIECE OF CHAMOMILE PETAL!!1!1!one!!birbir!!

...

OK, I am calm. It is a playground for learning stuff we don't know at the moment.

## Plans

* Will implement it using react on the front-end.
* Backend probably will be on node.
* Will create a build system for front-end.
* Maybe try to use some testing frameworks.
* Design is focused on desktop mainly, will try to port it on mobile with media
  queries when the project is mature enough.
* Plans can be changed in the future as its getting implemented also
  technologies can be totally different then expected in future. Time and our
  interest will show the results.
* Maybe I can implement same stuff with different technologies on different
  branches. I don't know. As I said time will show us.
* We do not have a license at the moment. But it will be free in the end.
